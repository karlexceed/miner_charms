Miner Charms
=====
This mod adds helpful charms for mining.

If you're mining hundreds or thousands of blocks at a time, then dealing with inventory space becomes as much of a hassle as managing your tools.
Miner Charms are the solution!
* The Stone Repel Charm will keep all variations of cobblestone from filling your inventory.
* The Crumbly Repel Charm keeps away dirt, gravel, and sand.
